## Synaptic connectivity

> **A study of synaptic connectivity in healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with mental disorders**

Synaptic pathology has been suggested in the aetiology of schizophrenia and a number of incidental findings support the role of abnormalities in synaptic pathology in behavioural and cognitive impairments. Pre-synaptic markers help relate changes in synaptic density and a number of alterations in presynaptic markers such as presynaptic synaptic protein 2A:
SV2A
by allowing us to indirectly measure synaptic density *in vivo* using [11C]UCB-J - a selective radiotracer that binds to SV2A.
