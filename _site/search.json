Pre-synaptic markers help relate changes in synaptic density and a number of alterations in presynaptic markers such as presynaptic synaptic protein 2A: SV2A by allowing us to indirectly measure synaptic density in vivo using [11C]UCB-J - a selective radiotracer that binds to SV2A.\n\n Be part of research\n\n\nNIHR\n\n\nHRA"
